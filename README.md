# CarPricePredictor
The Car Price Predictor Model is a machine learning project developed to predict the price of cars. The model utilizes three algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Regressor. This repository contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the models.

Key Features
Model Comparison: The project compares the performance of three popular machine learning algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Regressor - for car price prediction. Each algorithm is trained and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Power BI Visualization: The project includes visualizations of the car price prediction results using Power BI. These visualizations provide insights into the factors affecting car prices and help in understanding the model's performance.
